This is the third and final class of a CSS animations for kids series; the first class and additional series details [can be found here](http://jonibologna.com/css-animation-classes-for-kids-class-1/).

**All original teaching materials for these classes [are open source](https://github.com/jonitrythall/dotdoodl-kid-classes)**, so please feel free to use them as is for copy and customize to your situation.

### Class 3: 3D Dot
The second class, [Bounce Dot](http://jonibologna.com/css-animation-classes-for-kids-class-2/), introduced `opacity`, animating size, coordinating two separate animations, manipulating the appearance of transitions through setting multiple moments, and defining transition timing in animation assignment.

This final class introduces x and y axis rotations, `preserve-3d`, unique border styling, `transform-origin`, and the `linear` timing-function value. This class can be conducted within 1 hour.

### Happy Teaching ðŸ‘‹
I hope these teaching materials prove handy and classes are enjoyable. I also recently wrote up some [general advice on conducting workshops](http://jonibologna.com/intro-to-writing-svg-and-tuts-town-workshops/).

Iâ€™m not sure what my next project will be just yet, but I have a questionable habit of sharing all my thoughts and adventures [on twitter](https://twitter.com/JoniTrythall).
