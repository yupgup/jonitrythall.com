I get so consumed with HTML and CSS these days I forget to continue practicing Illustrator. And that's just not right. People need regular Pigsercise. Like the need for exercise and sleep, but more important.

Today I learned a <a href="http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-tips/quick-tip-a-simple-way-to-create-vector-fog/" target="_blank">simple technique</a> concerning how to create fog. I think the story of two pigs in love emerging from the thick Seattle fog will be one of the greatest stories of our time.
