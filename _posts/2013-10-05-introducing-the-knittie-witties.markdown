So a while back I mentioned that I had an idea for a children's book and even had some character doodles. Over the past few months I have been working on this book and recently sent it in for a printed draft. Woo! While this project was one of the most enjoyable I have ever done, I am officially utterly sickened by the look on those knitted faces! Hopefully those reading it do not feel the same, however. Knowing when to stop was by far the most difficult part of this journey.

I took loads of pics along the way to document my half hearted attempts at doing something great. I realized that some may be curious about the mind numbing "process" of how I personally chose to create this mammoth of a personal project. So anyway, here it is:

The whole thing started with a random thought from my ever haunted mind. Then, sketches were in order. I drew up these characters and named them. I drew the entire book and scenes on paper first. I then traced the drawings and scanned them. I brought the scanned images into Illustrator and essentially hand traced them here. The book and characters then take on a whole other life in Illustrator when you have new ideas and improvements and add color of course!

Now I am (clearly) not a professional illustrator or writer, but this is a glimpse into how I went about making this little book. Feels nice to get this idea out of my head forever so I can move forward with my life! Again, totally haunted.

So, there is it. Hopefully I did right by the mini people this thing is targeted for and will not be inducing childhood nightmares for years to come. I will do another post when I get the actual book copies in my boney little hands, and copies are available upon request. You know, if you don't mind your kid being a psychological Guinea Pig.
