For last week’s Why Wiggle Work I gave a mini tour of our [Discord channels](https://jonitrythall.com/why-wiggle-work-channels). Today, I wanted to share a look at our specific events. These are always some of the trickier aspects of navigating an online community. There are different time zones, different work schedules, and it can be challenging to get people’s attention to let them know what’s going on. But, when it works out it’s absolutely delightful and goes a long way in establishing proper bonds.
