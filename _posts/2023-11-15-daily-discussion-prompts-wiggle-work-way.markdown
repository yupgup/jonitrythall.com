One of my favorite aspects of the Wiggle Work community so far is the daily discussion prompts in the general channel. Monday through Saturday, I post a prompt to kick off the day. Sometimes, the discussions stay within what’s posted, and better yet, sometimes, we end up on a weird path that at first glance, has no connection to the original prompt. For instance, one day, we started with “Friendly Fight” topics like dogs vs cats and landed on food safety guidelines. It’s a fun, unique way to get to know each other better fairly quickly since it brings up topics that would likely never come up organically–like someone sharing that they tape holiday cards to their ceiling.

ChatGPT was pretty helpful in assisting with these at first and still can be with a lot of very specific directions in an attempt to break out of the repetitiveness that has taken hold. In doing general web searches, I find that posts about this are so riddled with ads they are rendered useless or are exclusively for elementary students–who decided only kids need icebreakers?!

I’ve been doing these since the beginning and have a couple of months worth of prompts as a result. I wanted to share some of my favorites here in case anyone is looking to start these or add some new ones to their discussion prompt bank. The best prompts, however, seem to come from listening to the community–what are folks interested in, what are common themes in terms of wins and struggles, and what could lead to fun revelations based on specific personalities. So, while I hope this list proves helpful, there’s still a lot of observation to do that will make yours even better for your group. 

I aim to only present three specific questions a day, but some of these have more to account for multiple uses. I also try not to be overly prescriptive so that there’s wiggle room in responses. These are also all alliteration-based since that’s the Wiggle Work Way.

## Wiggly Wrap Up
If participating in any of these prompts sounds like a fun and energizing way to spend time, we’d love for you to join us. You can fill out the little [application here](https://wiggle.work/), or ask me questions [on Mastodon](https://mastodon.yupgup.com/@joni) or via [email](mailto:hello@wiggle.work). It really is what all the best parts of having coworkers and friends could and should be like, except we don’t have to resent each other for burning coffee in the break room. 

I can’t wait to hang out and learn important things about you, like if you eat toast.
