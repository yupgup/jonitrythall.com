I created a weird resource a couple years ago that continues to be my most popular creation to date, a [Flexbox Cheatsheet Cheatsheet](http://jonibologna.com/flexbox-cheatsheet/); I still use this often myself. I‚Äôve been asked several times if there is a printed version of this and recently decided to revamp the project and make it happen: *A Field Guide to Flexbox*.

### What It Is
This is a 36 page, 4x6, premium paper weight, perfect bound, visual, printed guide book to getting started with [CSS Flexbox layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes); based on the original Cheatsheet with a few additional declarations and examples.

The guide features redesigned fruit illustrations to communicate fundamental concepts and the impact of different container and item declarations.

*A Field Guide to Flexbox* serves as an endlessly handy introduction to using flexbox but also as a beautiful addition to your workspace. It‚Äôs perfectly suited for those just getting started or for the rest of us that just can‚Äôt seem to remember all these options and need a reference to carry around.

### What It Is Not
This guide is not a complete guide to using flexbox.

There are no pages full of text that speak to browser support and potential gotchas, but there is a page of additional resources to help point you in the right direction in your journey to flex all the things.

### Outline
There are five primary sections: foundational concepts, activate powers, container declarations, item declarations, and additional resources.

</div>

### Layout
This small guide presents common questions regarding layout intentions and responds to different options with properties and values, as well as the visual implications of each choice. There are page numbers on each page next to a section title as a reminder; especially helpful in recalling whether or not a declaration is intended to be placed on a container or item element, for example.

The first and final two pages are reserved for some rad fruit art.

### Neat Words of Praise
‚ÄúI can never remember the flexbox properties, so I‚Äôm thrilled to have *A Field Guide to Flexbox* by my side. Joni‚Äôs illustrations are equal parts delightful and easy to follow, making it my new go-to resource.‚Äù<br>

‚ÄúThis handy guide is a wonderful resource, especially for a visual learner, like myself. Joni does a great job of breaking down fundamental concepts into easy to understand (and super cute!) bite sized pieces. If i had a guide like this for all web design concepts I‚Äôd be golden.‚Äù<br>
