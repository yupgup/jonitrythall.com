Haven't done a "Pigsercise" in a while and I figured Christmas was as good as an excuse as any. I didn't actually learn and use any new techniques for this guy, but I figured poking around Ai at all would be a good refresher, as I've been spending all my time these days with HTML and CSS. When I decided to do something holiday related I knew I would have to dress this pig in <a href="http://jonibologna.com/2013/10/printed-knittie-witties/" target="_blank">The Knittie Witties</a>! He's so cozy now.
