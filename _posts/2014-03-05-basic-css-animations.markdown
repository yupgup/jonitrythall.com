I recently wrote an article for [HTML5HUB](http://html5hub.com/) on basic CSS animations with Franklin the fish.

The tutorial addresses the sheer, unadulterated fun involved in creating CSS drawings and how to get them moving! Well, swimming in this case. The entire experience was amazing and I learned a lot about tutorial writing. Like the fact that it's the hardest thing ever in the world. But also the coolest. Do people still use "cool" anymore?

The HTML5HUB team was a real treat to work with as well. The whole thing was professional and fancy. Basically, I got a taste of tutorial writing and need more ASAP.

I only hope he remembers me when he's rich and famous and leaves me for someone that can provide him with a larger background to swim in.

Happy Franklin creating!
