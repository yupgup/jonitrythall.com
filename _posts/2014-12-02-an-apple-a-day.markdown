...keeps the dev blues away? I don't know, I just like illustrated fruit.

I am a total sucker for an adorably themed daily coding exercise project. The very first one that ever caught my eye was [Alex Bergin's A to Z CSS animations](http://cssaz.tumblr.com/). He did an amazing job with this and it was really neat to see the alphabet unfold and come to life. Would be impossible for me to choose the one I hearted the most from all these.

The next one that got my equally as excited was the [single div project by Lynn Fisher](http://a.singlediv.com/). I mean, look at that crayon!

Most recently ["A Triangle Each Day"](http://winkervsbecks.github.io/a-triangle-everyday/) had my attention. I love the simplicity of the triangle theme and the endless opportunities it presents. The [sleepy elk demo](http://winkervsbecks.github.io/a-triangle-everyday/sleepy-elk-triangle/) was my favorite, because adorable.

I decided to start this little project because I am finding there are certain skills I just don't use on a daily basis while I work. If I don't practice something regularly I completely forget it (seriously, it's like it never happened), so this is my attempt at keeping the skills I do have fresh to death but also learning new things as I go.

The theme I decided to go with, which may shock exactly no one, is apples. I'm not sure how frequent this will be, but will try to create one quick pen a day. This may not be realistic, but "An Apple on Random Occasions" just didn't have the same ring to it.

Basically, I was just looking for a fun way to practice some coding skills without having the stress of deadlines and rules...other than the obvious self imposed rule of there needing to be apples involved; I've overused cherries in the past and am feeling pretty guilty.

If you are interested in following along you can [check the project out on GitHub here](http://jonitrythall.github.io/appleproject/). For the first exercise I played around with using Sass for page color themes.

Any general comments or demo suggestions? [I hang out on Twitter sometimes](https://twitter.com/JoniTrythall).
