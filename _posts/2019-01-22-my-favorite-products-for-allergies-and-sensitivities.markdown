Due to loads of health issues in the house, including asthma, allergies, eczema, and just wildly sensitive skin and sinuses I have spent the past seven years searching for the safest skin, hair, and cleaning products.  

![Photo of a bunch of allergy-friendly body products thrown about the floor](/content/2019/01/IMG_0310.JPG)

I refer to the [EWGâ€™s Skin Deep Database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) as often as possible and try to avoid artificial fragrances, gluten, sunflower seed and nut oils (except coconut), dairy, and too harsh chemicals. Iâ€™ve tried countless products, spent countless hours on research, and have gone through thousands of dollars to figure this all out and thought it would be neat to write up a post that I wish I had previously. 

Iâ€™ve found that my local health food market has many of these items and while they are a bit more expensive than they would be online the local store guarantees all their products, so if something doesnâ€™t work out it can be returned. I also use [Thrive Market](https://thrivemarket.com) a lot. 

Hereâ€™s a big ol' list of products we have been using consistently for years. I hope it helps.
