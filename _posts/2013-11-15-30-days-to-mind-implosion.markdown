After spending several weeks over at <a title="Codecademy" href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> I was ready to venture into some more intermediate tutorials. Finding intermediate level teachings has proven a challenge. There has not been a shortage of intro to HTML and CSS stuff on the web, but intermediate level gets a little fuzzy. My challenges with attempting this on my own have been that I truly do not know what I don't know. So, where do I go once I have the fundamentals? Having spent most of my adult life in a structured classroom, I have come to long for the comforts and predictability of a syllabus. My replacement for this formal learning outline have been a magical marriage between <a title="HTML CSS in 30 Days" href="http://freecourses.tutsplus.com/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial and <a title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Visual-QuickStart-Quickstart-ebook/dp/B00ECYZ7SU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384450279&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=html+and+css" target="_blank">this</a> book.

I came across the 30 days tutorial and really liked how everything was laid out. I was able to skip through the first couple weeks as I feel I got a fairly good grasp on this through other sources. Starting at the third week, I watched the videos and practiced what I was learning in my <a title="Joni's CodePen" href="http://codepen.io/jonitrythall" target="_blank">CodePen</a> account. I divided each page and did both things at once. The efficiency was a beautiful sight; so much so that I took a screen shot to look back at when times get tough.  <a href="http://jonibologna.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-14-at-9.27.43-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-400" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-14 at 9.27.43 AM" src="http://jonibologna.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-14-at-9.27.43-AM.png" width="708" height="656" /></a><a href="http://jonibologna.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-14-at-9.34.23-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-409" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-14 at 9.34.23 AM" src="http://jonibologna.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-14-at-9.34.23-AM-1024x563.png" width="625" height="343" /></a>An additional amazing thing I learned from these videos so far is <a title="Validator" href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">VALIDATION</a>. You can actually run your work (HTML &amp; CSS) through this site and it will list any warnings and errors you may have on the page...so cool. I have noticed that is it not always correct and sometimes points out things that are not actually errors, but it is a very helpful <em>guide</em>. Basically it points out your mistakes even though it makes a lot of them itself, but you don't take it personally because it's a site. Fun! (Which I mean quite literally as my life is obviously pretty low key these days). <a href="http://jonibologna.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-14-at-9.46.17-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-14 at 9.46.17 AM" src="http://jonibologna.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-14-at-9.46.17-AM.png" width="634" height="598" /></a>I have been using the book as a reference when I run in to terms that I am not familiar with (which is most) and for a quick refresher for things that my old brain is refusing to retain; damn you relative and absolute positioning! It has been a very useful and easy read so far. Plus, pictures are always a good thing.

Happy imploding!
