**If you enjoy this weird little reference you may also be interested in the updated, revamped PDF version: [A Field Guide to Flexbox](https://gum.co/UVuuf)**.

While I am no stranger to the magic of [Flexbox](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/), I find that I am not using it very often just yet. As a result I end up pausing and referring back to [this post at CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) whenever an opportunity to utilize its powers presents itself.

I set out to create a *quick* visual to summarize Flexbox when I run into these moments of pause in the future. I like to think of it as a little diagram (flow chart? decision tree-ish thing?) that is a cheatsheet...based on cheatsheets.

Anyway, I thought I would share it just in case others may find such a resource beneficial as well. You can also take a look at [the demo I used over at CodePen](http://codepen.io/jonitrythall/pen/e706425b447c485247fd31d5378cc32e) to practice/tinker your flexible heart out.

If you would prefer to have this guy as a PDF you can [grab that here](http://jonibologna.com/content/flexboxsheet.pdf).
