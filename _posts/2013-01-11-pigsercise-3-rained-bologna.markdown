While I didn't use the technique in this <a title="Vector Tut" href="http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/designing/create-a-cool-water-ripple-effect/" target="_blank">tutorial</a>, it's a great walk through on creating a rippled water effect in Ai.

Hope this provides you with visual delightedness.
