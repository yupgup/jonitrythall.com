Here are my children's books for free PDF download!

[**The Knittie Witties**](http://jonibologna.com/assets/books/TheKnittieWittiesALL.pdf) is a baby book about knitted animal characters with the following description:
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Arff Arff the Puppy Scarf spends all this time with this best friend, the Boy. On the way to school one day the Boy accidentally drops Arff Arff. Their efforts to find each other uncovers a whole new world of knitted friends. </em></p>

[**You and I**](http://jonibologna.com/assets/books/You-and-I-by-Joni-Bologna.pdf) is a toddler book about ... trash. It is the story of a boy and the delightfully mundane activity of throwing things away and waiting all week for the garbage truck to show itself. A trashy book that is appropriate for kids.
