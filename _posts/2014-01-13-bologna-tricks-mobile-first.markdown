I set out to practice replicating a mobile page today, and ended up choosing this screenshot from <a href="http://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-TRICKS</a>Â as a model:

<em>Oh no! Unfortunately this image has been lost forever</em> ðŸ˜±

This proved to be a great homework assignment for a couple reasons (other than getting that damn pig positioned!). First, it got me thinking small. It is hard to anticipate how easy it will be to use <a href="http://jonibologna.com/2014/01/media-queries-intro/" target="_blank">media queries</a> to design a full page layout once you have everything itty bitty in place. I kept wanting to just make a full screen version and go from there. This would be a mistake for a few reasons. If I were actually designing this site from scratch myself,Â <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first" target="_blank">mobile first</a> (itty bitty!) would keep me focused: What is the most important content? Which images will actually contribute to enhancing that content? Do I even need images? You know, no filler.

It also throws you into <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/" target="_blank">responsive design</a>, whether you like it or not. That itty bitty layout is not going to be acceptable on a tablet or full computer screen. The main issue here was creating a media query that lined all the navigation boxes up across a larger screen.

In addition to all that it was a lot of fun, I mean, look at that face! I suppose the next step is designing one of these guys myself.

I also enjoyedÂ <a href="http://designshack.net/articles/css/mobilefirst/" target="_blank">this</a>Â article from Design Shack on this topic.

Happy mobile firsting!
