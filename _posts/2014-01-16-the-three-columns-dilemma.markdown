Today I set out to replicate <a href="http://codepen.io/bradfrost/full/zhCwd" target="_blank">this</a> three column gem from Brad Frost using CSS.

I structured this by placing columns 2 and 3 in <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags, and the main content in a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag. Once getting everything in order as far as a mobile view, the issue I quickly ran into was getting the main content in the middle once I added a media query for larger screens. Before tackling this thing I assumed I would be floating them all and Internet magic would sort everything out. Well, I was half right.

Floating all the elements was necessary, however, the second and main columns needed a bit more convincing to line up through the use of margin-left values. Â

So, while I plan to dive into grids this week, I decided to punish myself first and do things this way.Â Brad Frost also has a <a href="http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html" target="_blank">collection of responsive patterns</a> that make perfect practice pieces.

Happy column sorting!
