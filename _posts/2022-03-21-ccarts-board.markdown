I joined the board of the [Center for the Creative Arts](https://www.ccarts.org) (CCArts) in nearby Yorklyn, Delaware last week and am completely thrilled.

After attending a Yorklyn Days event several years ago I became familiar with the center. It’s located in an adorable old school building in one of my favorite parts of Delaware, surrounded by woods, trails, and old industrial buildings being taken over by nature. There’s a wildflower field there where Ben and I release monarchs and Tillie gets her hair cut at a cute little grooming shop behind what used to be House Industries. I find that I go there quite often, each time noticing and thinking about the art center.    

I signed Ben up for a weekend clay class which provided the opportunity to see the inside of the building and experience what their classes are like. It’s been something that he’s really gotten into and we’ve started to do it at home as well. We were impressed and signed him up for summer camps there as well. He’s always gotten a lot of crafts and being able to be artistic–I’m thrilled to see what other new interests he develops there.

It’s definitely the type of kind and welcoming environment that allows kids (and adults!) to explore new artistic hobbies and careers. They learn new ways of expressing and understanding themselves, gain confidence, make lasting friendships, build fine motor skills, and develop unique problem solving skills. Plus, it just brings so much joy and enrichment to make beautiful things with your hands that are a part of you that you can share with others. When I was younger art got me through some fairly hard times. When I sat down to draw I was able to be truly in the moment, not worrying about the past or future. It allowed me to focus, which was difficult, and pushed my creativity in a way that directly supports my current career as a designer.   

The mission of inspiring, transforming, and enriching the lives of people of all ages and abilities through the arts is one that felt especially powerful and relevant. I couldn’t stop thinking about it and realized that was significant–I wanted to be directly involved in carrying out such an important mission.

The executive director, Melissa Paolercio, and I met to discuss how I could help the center. I I learned more about the programs, the building, and the people. The more I learned the more certain I was that I wanted to make the commitment involved with being on the board and I was voted in on March 16th–attending the first board meeting that day.

The center has been doing incredible work in the community for over 38 years, and I’m honored to be a part of the next few–and anxious to get to work! If you happen to live in the area and are looking to try out a new art class I couldn’t recommend CCArts enough. And maybe I’ll see you there :)
