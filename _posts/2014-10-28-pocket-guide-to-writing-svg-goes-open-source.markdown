It has been a couple months since the wrap up of my [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1207904509/pocket-guide-to-writing-svg) for Pocket Guide to Writing SVG. [The book was published](http://svgpocketguide.com/) over a month ago and since that time I have had an overwhelming urge to give this thing away to anyone in need of such a resource.

I have struggled with this because while I ultimately have always wanted this book to be free, I had to take a significant amount of time off to write it.  

The Kickstarter and sales to follow helped make it possible for me to finally open source this project, which is pretty damn neat. Assuming you are one of these people, myself and now many others thank you wholeheartedly.

When I first got started with inline SVG I found it so be, well, [bananas](https://dribbble.com/shots/1677187-SVG-Mugs?list=users&offset=6). It was really difficult to find true beginner resources. Luckily this is quickly changing and my hope is that *Pocket Guide to Writing SVG* can contribute to this growing open source knowledge and fill in any potential gaps.

It just didn't feel right to me to acknowledge that I struggled finding beginner friendly resources when getting started and then create one that was not accessible to everyone. But again, none of this would have been possible without the support I have received thus far.

As "feelings" as this may sound, the support of the design and development communities helped make this book a reality and now I would like to give it out in hopes of helping others that may also be wondering where to begin and find themselves thinking "What the flip does all this code even mean?!".

**You can view the source code and be part of the [Github project here](https://github.com/jonitrythall/svgpocketguide), as well as access the content [on the book's site](http://svgpocketguide.com/book/). All for free.** I have also added CodePen demos for examples throughout the guide on the book's site for further tinkering.

**The [PDF can still be purchased here](https://gumroad.com/l/LzxQ).** I was unable to make this format available for free due to the fact that I pay a professional rockstar to maintain edits. It also allows for a better reading experience and enables the continued support of the project.  

My mom has called the PDF "very pretty" on several occasions, so I feel like this is a pretty solid endorsement. View a [sneak peek of the PDF here](http://svgpocketguide.com/svgpocketguidepreview.pdf).
