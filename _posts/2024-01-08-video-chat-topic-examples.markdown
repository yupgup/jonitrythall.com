Inspired by [Matt Stein’s](https://mattstein.com/) sharing of [Rafał Pastuszak’s](https://sonnet.io/) work, I’m gearing up to offer video call chats in the new year. Part of the preparations involve offering a list of example topics. So, while I’m open to chatting about whatever’s stuck in your mind, there are some things I get especially energetic about, and perhaps we have that in common–what a beautiful thing when that happens.  

<hr />

So, here’s a list of things I’d be overly enthusiastic to chat with you about. These are in the random order that my brain produced them in. 

- What is a brand
- Establishing a friendly brand
- Branding vs marketing 
- Content design and strategy 
- Design process
- Wiggle Work
- Friendly branding and design 
- Design for developers 
- Working with developers 
- Pollinators and other bugs
- ADHD
- Anxiety 
- Spine injuries 
- Running a micro agency 
- Design feedback 
- Community building
- Print design basics
- Dark design patterns 
- Client relationships
- Allergy-free baking
- Remote work
- Sneakers
- Healthy-ish snacking
- Introverted extrovert dilemmas 
- General idea riffing

This is probably the type of post I will update often as more things come to mind and my interests expand (and contract). 

We can hang out if you [follow this scheduling link](https://calendly.com/jonitrythall).
