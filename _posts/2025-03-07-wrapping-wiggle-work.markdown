I took the month of February off from community activities to create room for reflection and planning. It was very productive, and I realized a lot of things about myself, work, and the space at large. The result here is that I am permanently departing from Wiggle Work and I wanted to use this post to say goodbye and speak a bit about what happens next. **Today, March 7th, will be my final prompt and I will officially leave Discord on March 21st**.

## Happy Happenings, Deep Dilemma 
While not a straightforward decision, I believe it boils down to the misalignment of goals. Iâ€™ve loved managing this community and making sure it felt cozy, welcoming, and active. Iâ€™m grateful for people choosing to spend their remote hours hanging outâ€”trusting that I would create a safe and enjoyable spaceâ€”and am grateful for the friendships I could create and strengthen here.

But Iâ€™ve loved managing this space so much that thereâ€™s a lot more I would like to do. I have so many ideas and plans for onboarding, special events, new discussion questions, and growth. These plans were motivating, but quickly burned out when I remembered this is not a paid community. 

My personal goals at Wiggle Work changed significantly in the last year and a half. Initially designed to connect lonely remote workers, I soon discovered even a basic version was surprisingly demanding. As a member, it would be easier to come and go as my schedule allowed. As the manager, my role requires generating discussion topics, responding to comments, facilitating engaging activities, and ensuring the culture is as inviting as possible, regardless of my daily workload. Creating a meaningful space requires active effort and sufficient funding.

Additionally, Iâ€™ll be working towards some *big* professional and personal changes that need my full attention and resources. I havenâ€™t had the opportunity or circumstances for change in many years, and I couldnâ€™t be more excited and energized about a new path forward.

## Fun Future
I will, unfortunately, have to take the Wiggle Work name and brand along with me. However, I will transfer the Discord server over to the incredible [Richard Terry](https://mastodon.yupgup.com/@radiac@radiac.net), who you know as radiac. Richard has been an active, hilarious, thoughtful member from the beginning and I know he will keep the space feeling both familiar and fresh with new ideas that perfectly fit the developer audience that has taken hold. 

Heâ€™s still working out a name, but I hear he will do a poll and a beloved, custom, delightful, odd domain name is on the table. I donâ€™t want to say too much, but tacos are involved. 

I hope everyone continues to find refuge within the space and make lasting professional and personal connections while also spending too much time in distraction-den.

Iâ€™m not entirely sure where I will land, as I will likely be departing Mastodon as well, but Iâ€™ll always have [email](mailto:hello@jonitrythall.com) and be on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonitrythall/).

Wishing everyone the best of luck and I hope to see you aroundâ€”thank you all ðŸ§¡
