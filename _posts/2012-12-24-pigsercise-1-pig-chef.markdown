I wanted to see a pig cooking a strawberry. I really hope I do not have to explain myself further here, the need to see this should be obvious.

This Pigsercise allowed me to practice a number of simple, beginner friendly techniques in Illustrator, including: layers!, shading, adding and editing gradients, using the pen on the tail and ears, combining shapes, layers!, applying textures, adding text, adjusting opacity levels, layers!,  and creating a little depth with some shadows. I welcome feedback, suggestions, and questions.
