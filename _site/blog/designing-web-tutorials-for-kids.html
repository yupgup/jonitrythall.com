		<h1>Designing Web Tutorials For Kids</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">01 June 2015</p>

		<p>For the last couple months I’ve been developing a kid’s web design tutorial series for <strong>Tuts+</strong>, <strong><a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/web-design-for-kids--cms-823">Tuts+ Town</a></strong>. There are eleven tutorials total and a couple of them were published recently and will continue to throughout June.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/Screen-Shot-2015-05-31-at-1-28-39-PM-2.png" alt="Tuts+ Town building illustration" /></p>

<p>The series walks kids through some foundational level pieces like how the web works and how to manage site files, which leads to actually building a site together with HTML and CSS. There are then several courses devoted to understanding basic web design concepts like typography, whitespace, and color.</p>

<p>While I completely <em>adore</em> this project, I had a lot of doubts before I got started. Prior to this series I had never quite designed for kids in this capacity. A couple years ago I wrote and illustrated two preschool level books, but walking 10-13 year olds through HTML and CSS? Where do I even begin? What’s already out there and what can I do differently to improve upon these?</p>

<p>After a bit of research I ran into what I would now consider essential resources for designing tutorials for kids and pre-teens. I figured I would share these, as well as some lessons learned, in a quick post for other people in a similar situation.</p>

<h3 id="the-visuals">The Visuals!</h3>
<p>The first thing I felt was missing after reviewing a couple online tutorials for kids, aside from how few there are to begin with, were supportive visuals. There was a lot of content but no imagery to reinforce this content.</p>

<p>While visual support is important for learning in general, I feel that it’s especially crucial for younger learners. For example, following a writeup explaining how the web works without a diagram, in my opinion, is simply impossible even as an adult.</p>

<p>While the image below is a drastically simplified representation of how the web works, it hopefully provides Tuts+ Town readers with a <em>general</em> idea of what’s going on behind the scenes, demystifying the process a bit.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/Screen-Shot-2015-05-31-at-1-44-22-PM.png" alt="How the web works illustration" /></p>

<p>Even diagrams that depict what happens when a CSS document is incorrectly versus correctly linked in HTML can go a long way in representing and understanding overall <em>concepts</em> taking place.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/Screen-Shot-2015-05-31-at-1-46-06-PM.png" alt="Illustration showing the result of a successfully linked CSS documents" /></p>

<p>While writing the Tuts+ Town series I tried to stay mindful of what things would lend well to visual representation and then brainstorm the most straightforward graphics to depict these concepts.</p>

<h4 id="a-theme">A Theme</h4>
<p>It was important to me to have a theme for this series to keep everything consistent and cohesive; <em>plus</em> it’s just more fun for everyone. Any tutorials I had come across with themes were much easier to follow and the connection between all facets of web design were much clearer.</p>

<p>Having a fictional town theme allowed for different buildings to represent different parts of web design and lends well to especially neat images, like maps.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/Screen-Shot-2015-05-31-at-1-31-42-PM-1.png" alt="Illustrated map of Tuts Town" /></p>

<p>It’s also very common for a town to have a website, so the main task throughout the first part of the series is creating one for Tuts+ Town.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/Jun/Screen-Shot-2015-06-01-at-7-42-54-AM.png" alt="Illustrated preview of Tuts Town site" /></p>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>Some of the most useful resources I came across in preparing for Tuts+ Town were books, so I wanted to share which ones were my absolute favorite and touch on what makes them so special.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/pic1-1.jpg" alt="Picture of several books used as references for series" /></p>

<h4 id="design-for-kids">Design For Kids</h4>
<p>The very first book I picked up to prepare for this series was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Kids-Digital-Products-Learning/dp/1933820306/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433100732&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=design+for+kids">Design for Kids by Debra Levin Gelman</a>. The best thing about this book is that it breaks up the information by age group, so I specifically focused on chapter 8, “Kids 10-12: Growing Up”.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/pic3-1.jpg" alt="Picture of interior picture of Design for Kids book" /></p>

<p>This book left me with a better understanding of what kids this age are capable of. The author does a splendid job of summarizing information in table form, outlining the characteristics of kids in each age group and how this relates to digital design for them.</p>

<p>I view this book as a bit of a cheat sheet to understanding kids and what it means in terms of design. The author has done a lot of research and shares it with the reader in a wonderfully organized, thoughtful way.</p>

<h4 id="build-your-own-website">Build Your Own Website</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Build-Your-Own-Website-WordPress/dp/1593275226/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433100793&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=build+your+own+website">Build Your Own Website by Nate Cooper</a> is an absolute <em>must</em> as a reference for communicating complex technical concepts in a highly visual way and I cannot recommend this one enough.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/pic11-2.jpg" alt="Interior picture of Build Your Own Website book" /></p>

<p>Cooper presents HTML and CSS in an incredibly easy to digest, fun way. The guide is in comic form and tells a neat story in addition to teaching the reader bunches about building a site.</p>

<h4 id="information-graphics">Information Graphics</h4>
<p>Information Graphics is a <em>beautiful</em> series of infographics for kids on topics ranging from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Graphics-Human-Simon-Rogers/dp/0763671231/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_z">human body</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Graphics-Space-Simon-Rogers/dp/0763677698/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433100810&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=information+graphics+space">space</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Graphics-Kingdom-Simon-Rogers/dp/0763671223/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y">animals</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/pic7-2.jpg" alt="Interior picture of space infographic book" /></p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/pic5-1.jpg" alt="Interior picture of infographic book related to human body parts" /></p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/pic13-1.jpg" alt="Interior picture of infographic book on animals" /></p>

<p><em>Seriously though, look at those images!</em></p>

<p>Concerning the 10-13 year old age group I found the Space book to be the most helpful. It takes fairly complicated facts, like how space is measured, and presents them in fun and interesting graphics.</p>

<p>Informative as well as a real pieces of art for all ages.</p>

<h4 id="help-your-kids-with-computer-coding">Help Your Kids With Computer Coding</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Help-Your-Kids-Computer-Coding/dp/146541956X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433101024&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=help+your+kids+with+computer+coding">Help You Kids With Computer Coding</a> from DK provides a beautiful breakdown of getting started with programming.</p>

<p>While my series doesn’t touch on programming, this book was super handy in getting a sense of how very basic graphics can be used to communicate complex technical concepts.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015/May/pic10-1.jpg" alt="Interior picture of Help Your Kids with Computer Coding book" /></p>

<p>This book provides a supportive visual for everything, from communicating technical how-tos to describing the higher level concepts of programming (like comparing it to baking muffins in the image above!).</p>

<p>My main take away from this book though was how completely <em>thorough</em> the authors are. They give step by step instructions for everything, including how to install the necessary tools on your computer for all operating systems.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>I learned a lot in developing and writing this series. One of the hardest parts of the entire project was eliminating <em>all</em> assumptions of existing knowledge. I couldn’t assume the audience already knew how files work or how the internet works, for example.</p>

<p>It’s easy to lose touch with the struggles of a beginner in general, but this becomes even more difficult when you factor in a much younger audience. So, perhaps the best advice I can give is to <strong>make no assumptions and eliminate all jargon</strong>.</p>

<p>Knowing all the right jargon is simply not necessary to get started with this stuff, so using it can often leave a reader frustrated and defeated.</p>

<p>Even having only been in web design a few years it was all too difficult to keep this in mind throughout all eleven tutorials; while some things can quickly become obvious as you get comfortable, nearly nothing is when first getting started.</p>

<p>PLUS, having a fantastic editor always helps, thanks <a href="http://tutsplus.com/authors/ian-yates">Ian</a>!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><img src="/content/2015/May/Screen-Shot-2015-05-31-at-1-30-27-PM-1.png" alt="Illustration of Tuts Town designer waving goodbye from her desk" /></p>

<p>Tuts+ Town is by far one of my favorite projects so far, truly encompassing all my passions: teaching, illustration, design. It was also a total plesure working with <a href="http://tutsplus.com/">Tuts+</a> for the first time.</p>

<p>As someone that got into web design much later in life, I can’t help but wish I had been exposed to resources like this series and some of the books listed here. <strong>Web design and coding should be accessible to all</strong>, and teaching kids how to get started in a fun and thorough way is a fantastic step towards ensuring this becomes reality.</p>

<p>Hopefully this little curated list of books and pieces of advice proves handy for others wanting to design digital content for kids but don’t know exactly where to start.</p>

<p>So, as we say in Tuts+ Town, “See you around town!”.</p>
